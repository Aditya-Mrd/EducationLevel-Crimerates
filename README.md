### Requirements

* Pandas 2.2.2
* Matplotlib 3.9.0

* Numpy 1.26.4
* Addfips 0.4.2
* Sci-kit Learn 1.5.1

### About the Study
This study was conducted under Renaissance Learning. This study looks at the relationship between education and crime rates in the USA, using county level datasets. It compares variables such as the percentage of people in a county that attained a high school diploma, or the percentage of people in a county that attained an associatee's degree, and more against the number of violent crimes in the county (murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults). From this, we hope to understand crime better, and get a sense of what may be driving crime in the USA.

### Notebooks
The notebooks are seperated in two notebooks: data manipulation, and data analysis.

The data manipulation notebook mainly focuses on cleaning and combining the crime, education, and populations datasets in a singular format, with minimal graphs.

The data analysis notebooks mainly focuses on analysing the dataset created in the data manipulation notebook, and includes detailed graphs that show the relationship between educational attainment and crime rates. It also includes correlation results between crime rates and various educational attainment levels.
