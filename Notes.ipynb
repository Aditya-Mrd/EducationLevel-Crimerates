    "**7/2/2024**\n",
    "\n",
    "2016 is the year for all these datasets because it is the most recent year that I can find county level crime data from. For more recent data, I might have to look at and combine datasets made by individual states. More recent years such as 2023 might not have enough data, and years such as 2020-2022 have data impacted by Covid-19, which could lead to inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the education dataset by the USDA is from 2018-2022, currently looking for a viable 2016 dataset. I might just have to pick a specific year, find state-made datasets for education and crime, and then combine them. This is because most USA wide county level education data seems to be between a set of years (such as 2018-22, or 2005-2016, etc.). Another option is to pick a state and just analyze that one state, because data is probable easier to find for individual states.\n",
    "\n",
    "More data is available for regional data, but I feel like education data across such a large area as a region will not be specific enough to analyze, due to the data being averaged across such a wide variety of educations levels. This averaging can remove variation within the data, and make it too general. \n",
    "\n",
    "Florida has 67/68 of its counties have a converage indicator of 0 in the ICPSR data, so I found a different dataset specifically for florida.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7/3/2024**\n",
    "\n",
    "(Was going to just focus on minnesota, but found the sites listed below) Found specific minnesota data for educational attainment in 2016: https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2016.B06009?q=minnesota%20education&g=010XX00US_040XX00US27$0500000&y=2016&moe=true \n",
    "\n",
    "Found 2016 data for educational attainment USA County Level: https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2016.S1501?q=Educational%20Attainment&g=010XX00US,$0500000&y=2016 \n",
    "\n",
    "Found the census data site with a bunch of different data, very useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "**7/10/2024**\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to get some county level data from the UCR reporting system. Decided to remove a lot of columns from the main dataset because the florida dataset does not have those columns, and it will make analysis simpler. \n",
    "\n",
    "**7/11/2024**\n",
    "\n",
    "I found some population datasets, but they have about half the amount of rows as my crime data dataset, which makes them unusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7/17/24**\n",
    "\n",
    "Merged the population and crime rate dataset, took a LOT of cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**7/18/24**\n",
    "\n",
    "Found new education dataset that works better than the previos one due to being in a easier to manage format"
